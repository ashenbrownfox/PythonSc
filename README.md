# PythonSc

##What it is:

This serves as a Reconnaissance Scanner for networks. The application modules are written in individual Python modules.

## Dependencies:

Python v2.x or v3.x (either one will work)
## How to use:

Python 3.4 is installed on the stable release of Ubuntu 14.04. You need to use python3 to use python 3.4. 
(For example, to compile a script file.py, use the command: python3 file.py)
I compiled in PyCharm and it worked just fine.
